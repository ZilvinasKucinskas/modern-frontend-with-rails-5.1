# Modern front-end in Rails

Project to experiment. Say no to Turbolinks, no to Sprockets, no to coffeescript.

The idea is to have separate `frontend` folder for front-end developers and to have css, js and erb files together in the same folder.

## What's included?

* Webpack
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org) - [36.4 times faster than SASS](https://github.com/postcss/benchmark)
    * Includes [cssnext features](http://cssnext.io/features/) out of the box
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org) - The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX
* Rails 5.1

## Features

* Automatic page update without refresh after modifying frontend code.

## Code Style

* [Prettier](https://prettier.io) - Opinionated Code Formatter. (Alternative would be [Standard](https://standardjs.com))
* [Airbnb javascript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
